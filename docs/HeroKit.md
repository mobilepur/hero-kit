# HeroKit

HeroKit's goal is to provide a convenient way to add navigation bar like headers to your UIViewController.

The idea for this project came with the release of iOS 26 when Apple decided to no longer support colored navigation bars in conjunction with large headers.

With this library you will be able to add 
- colored navigation bars that collapse when scrolling up like you were used to with pre-iOS 26 versions
- images that collapse when scrolling up
- views that collapse when scrolling up
